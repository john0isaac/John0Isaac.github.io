## Goals

Your team will obtain the starter, deploy the application to the cloud, download and run the source code locally, and make modifications to the site.

1. [Obtain and deploy the template to the cloud](./goals/1-deploy.md):
   Because the pet shelter wants the application to be publicly available, your team will need to deploy the application. For this workshop, your team will use Azure Static Web Apps, which is able to host the application and run the Azure Functions.
1. [Download and run the application locally](./goals/2-local.md):
   After creating the project on GitHub and deploying it to Azure Static Web Apps, each member of your team will download the project and run it locally for development purposes.
1. [Modify the site and push updates](./goals/3-modify.md):
   The template uses a relatively generic example of a task management system. You want to update the landing page to display a proper welcome message and update the verbiage to include the suggested usage - tracking what the pet adopter needs to do post adoption.
